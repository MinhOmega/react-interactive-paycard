  React Interactive Paycard
</h1>

Inspired by the [vue-interactive-paycard](https://github.com/muhammederdem/vue-interactive-paycard) and [react-interactive-paycard](https://github.com/jasminmif/react-interactive-paycard) projects, I decided to recreate the same functionality in ReactJS, using TypeScript throughout. Additionally, I developed an example website to demonstrate how it works within a NextJS framework.

## Notes

- The component is only available in a browser environment. If you are using Next.js App Router or any other framework that utilizes Server Components, make sure to use this component within a Client Component by adding the directive [`use client`](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/use-client).

## Roadmap

- [x] Convert all code to TypeScript
- [x] Create an example website and build the CI/CD pipeline to deploy it to GitHub Pages
- [ ] Refactor the code to use custom props for easier integration
- [ ] Add more card types and a prop to control validation
- [ ] Publish it as an NPM package and build the CI/CD pipeline for NPM publishing
